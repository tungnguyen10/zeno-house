## Status

**DEPRECATED** — Removed in change `2026-05-30-contract-as-assignment`.

Room assignment is now handled by contract lifecycle. Creating an active contract (`POST /api/contracts`) sets `room.status = 'occupied'`. Terminating a contract (`PATCH /api/contracts/:id` with `status: 'terminated'`) sets `room.status = 'available'`.

See `contracts-api` spec for current contract endpoints.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Assign room endpoint
`POST /api/room-assignments` SHALL create a new active assignment. Body: `room_id` (required), `tenant_id` (required), `start_date` (required, date string), `notes` (optional). Validates: room must exist and not be `maintenance`; room must have no active assignment record; tenant must exist and have no active assignment. On success: creates assignment record AND sets room.status = 'occupied'. Returns 201 with created assignment.

#### Scenario: Assign success
- **WHEN** admin POSTs valid assign data for an available room and unassigned tenant
- **THEN** returns 201 with assignment; room.status becomes 'occupied'

#### Scenario: Room not available
- **WHEN** admin tries to assign a room that is `maintenance`, or a room that already has an active assignment record
- **THEN** returns 409 CONFLICT with message indicating the room cannot be assigned

#### Scenario: Tenant already assigned
- **WHEN** admin tries to assign a tenant who already has an active assignment
- **THEN** returns 409 CONFLICT with message indicating tenant is already assigned to another room

#### Scenario: Validation error
- **WHEN** body is missing room_id, tenant_id, or start_date
- **THEN** returns 422 VALIDATION_ERROR

### Requirement: Unassign room endpoint
`DELETE /api/room-assignments/:id` SHALL end an active assignment by setting `end_date = today`. Also sets room.status = 'available'. Returns 200 with updated assignment. Returns 404 if assignment not found. Returns 409 if assignment already ended.

#### Scenario: Unassign success
- **WHEN** admin DELETEs an active assignment
- **THEN** end_date set to today; room.status becomes 'available'; returns 200

#### Scenario: Already ended
- **WHEN** assignment already has an end_date
- **THEN** returns 409 CONFLICT

### Requirement: Get current assignment for a room
`GET /api/room-assignments/room/:roomId` SHALL return the active assignment for a room (end_date IS NULL), including joined tenant info. Returns null data if no active assignment.

#### Scenario: Room has active tenant
- **WHEN** admin calls GET /api/room-assignments/room/:roomId for an occupied room
- **THEN** returns assignment with tenant fullName, phone, id

#### Scenario: Room is vacant
- **WHEN** room has no active assignment
- **THEN** returns { data: null }

### Requirement: Get current assignment for a tenant
`GET /api/room-assignments/tenant/:tenantId` SHALL return the active assignment for a tenant (end_date IS NULL), including joined room info (roomNumber, floor, building name). Returns null data if tenant has no active assignment.

#### Scenario: Tenant is assigned
- **WHEN** admin calls GET for an assigned tenant
- **THEN** returns assignment with room roomNumber, floor, building name

#### Scenario: Tenant not assigned
- **WHEN** tenant has no active assignment
- **THEN** returns { data: null }
